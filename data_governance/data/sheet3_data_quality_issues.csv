Existing Issue;Column;Table;Issue;Dimension;Description;Example;Suggested Resolution;Suggested Data Quality Rule;Data Quality Metric
Yes;ShoeType;listings;NULL values in ShoeType column;Completeness;The ShoeType column contains NULL values despite being important product information for buyers. ShoeType helps customers filter and search for specific footwear categories.;ListingID 922399 has ShoeType = NULL (see SQL line 1712);Make ShoeType a required field at data entry (application validation). Backfill existing NULL values by inferring from im.Items.Type field. Create data quality rule to prevent future NULLs.;Every listing must have a shoe type specified to help customers find the right product;Percentage of listings with NULL ShoeType = (COUNT of listings where ShoeType IS NULL / COUNT of all listings) × 100
Yes;LastName and FirstName;CustomerServiceRequests;Customer names don't match User Service system;Consistency and Accuracy;Customer names in the Customer Service system do not match the User Service system - indicating data entry errors or synchronization issues. This is a critical MDM issue.;UserID 3586: CustomerServiceRequests has LastName='Vamderheydem' (SQL line 2380) but usr.users has LastName='Vanderheyden' (SQL line 129) - spelling discrepancy;Implement MDM Hub to establish single source of truth for customer data. Add data validation at entry point in CS system (lookup against usr.users). Create nightly reconciliation job to identify and flag discrepancies. Train CS staff to verify customer information from authoritative source.;A customer's name in any system must exactly match the name in the User Service system of record;Count of customer service requests where customer name does not match User Service = COUNT WHERE cs.FirstName <> usr.users.FirstName OR cs.LastName <> usr.users.LastName for same UserID
Yes;Size;listings;Invalid size value '0';Validity and Accuracy;Shoe size contains invalid value '0' which is not a valid shoe size for any age group. Valid shoe sizes typically range from infant (0.5-2) to adult (3-20).;ListingID 780492 has Size = '0' (SQL line 1730) - size zero is invalid;Implement dropdown/validation list for size entry (application-level constraint). Add CHECK constraint to database. Investigate and correct existing '0' values by checking source data in im.Items. Create reference table of valid sizes by gender/age group.;Every shoe listing must have a valid size between 0.5 and 22 to ensure accurate product information;Count of listings with invalid shoe sizes = COUNT of listings WHERE Size = '0' OR Size NOT BETWEEN 0.5 AND 22
Yes;ArrivalDate;Items;Missing arrival dates prevent 45-day rule enforcement;Completeness and Timeliness;Some items in the warehouse inventory are missing arrival dates - making it impossible to track the 45-day listing deadline. Per business rules items must be listed within 45 days or returned to seller.;ItemID 46646 has ArrivalDate = NULL (SQL line 527);Make ArrivalDate mandatory at warehouse receipt (application requirement). Auto-populate ArrivalDate with current timestamp when ItemStatus = 'received'. Backfill NULL values with earliest possible date from shipping logs. Create alert system for items approaching 45-day limit.;Every item received at the warehouse must have an arrival date recorded to track the 45-day listing deadline;Percentage of items with missing arrival date = (COUNT of items where ArrivalDate IS NULL / COUNT of all items) × 100
No;Email and FirstName and LastName and Address;users;Risk of users creating multiple accounts;Uniqueness;There is a risk of users creating multiple accounts with slight variations in email addresses or names - leading to duplicate customer records. This could happen through typos or use of multiple email addresses or intentional fraud.;Potential example: Same person with john.smith@gmail.com and john.smith@yahoo.com OR 'Robert Johnson' vs 'Rob Johnson' with same address;Implement email uniqueness constraint (already exists via UserID as PK but enforce at app level). Add duplicate detection algorithm at registration (fuzzy name matching + address matching). Implement multi-factor authentication to verify identity. Create periodic reconciliation job to identify potential duplicates. Establish MDM customer matching rules.;Each person should have only one user account to maintain accurate customer history and prevent fraud;Count of potential duplicate users = COUNT of user pairs WHERE (same email domain + similar name) OR (same address + similar name)
